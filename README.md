## DSA
# Data structures
Algorithms are generally created independent of underlying languages, i.e. an algorithm can be implemented in more than one programming language

Data structures are introduced in order to store, organize and manipulate data in programming languages. They are designed in a way that makes accessing and processing of the data a little easier and simpler. These data structures are not confined to one particular programming language; they are just pieces of code that structure data in the memory.

# Task Description:
The task involves reading a list of integers from an input file, generating an output file containing a sorted list of unique integers from the input file, and storing the output file in the 'sample_results' directory within the 'hw01' directory.

# The basic steps to learn DSA is as follows:

* Step 1 - Learn Time and Space complexities
Time and Space complexities are the measures of the amount of time required to execute the code (Time Complexity) and amount of space required to execute the code (Space Complexity).

* Step 2 - Learn Different Data Structures
Here we learn different types of data structures like Array, Stack, Queye, Linked List et.

* Step 3 - Learn Different Algorithms
Once you have good undertanding about various data sturtcures then you can start learning associated algorithms to process the data stored in these data structures. These algorithms include searching, sorting, and other different algorithms.
